A CNN model created from scratch that classifies waste into organic and recyclable categories with an accuracy on 90.66%. 
The findings of this project were documented in a technical paper, "Waste Classification with Convolution Neural Networks" which was published in the **International Journal of Emerging Technologies and Innovative Research** (Volume 8, Issue 5), ISSN: 2349-5162
